Setup and Compilation
1. Download and unzip the submitted zip file from eLearning on a Linux box in the multi-platform lab.
2. Files placed in the zip file include but not limited to:
•	parser.c
•	lexer.c
•	main.c
•	error.c
•	symbol.c
•	global.h
•	test1.txt
•	test2.txt
•	test3.txt
•	test4.txt
•	illegaltest1.txt
•	illegaltest2.txt
•	illegaltest3.txt
•	illegaltest4.txt

3. Environment: Runs on a linux system with GNU, preferably ran in the mult-platform lab.
4. Compiling: It comes with a makefile. After unzipping the file, “cd” into the new folder.  From that location type in make.  After a success compilation you are ready to run the files.

5. Run batch file instead of makefile.  Give the right permissions to run the batch file then type "./batch" which will run a compilation then run each individual test.
6. Output file for generated code is file name + ".op" Example "test1.txt" - "test1.txt.op"

Output: All output goes to the console.
	./Parser testfiles/test1.txt
	Running parser for file name testfiles/test1.txt
	Parser ran
	File Name: testfiles/test1.txt
	Successful Parse

In case of an error you will see this:

	./Parser testfiles/illegaltest1.txt
	Running parser for file name testfiles/illegaltest1.txt
	Parser ran
	File Name: testfiles/illegaltest1.txt
	Error at line 10 position 2 :Invalid End of While loop
